# Officially Human Art Marketing Plan

## 1. Positioning & Core Message

**One-liner:** Officially Human Art is the trust layer between human creators and their audiences in the age of AI.

**Positioning statement:** For artists, writers, and musicians who need to prove their work is human-made, Officially Human Art provides verifiable, evidence-backed certification that buyers, galleries, and fans can trust — unlike simple declarations or AI-detection tools that are unreliable and adversarial.

**Key differentiators:**
- Evidence-based (not just a checkbox declaration)
- Tiered trust system rewards transparency (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Works across all creative mediums, not just visual art
- Embeddable badges and QR codes bring verification to the point of sale
- Free entry tier removes friction

## 2. Target Audiences

| Segment | Profile | Pain Point | Message |
|---------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Independent visual artists** | Sell on Etsy, galleries, commissions, social media | Buyers increasingly suspicious that work is AI-generated | "Stop losing sales to doubt" |
| **Freelance illustrators/designers** | Work with clients, agencies | Clients asking "did you use AI?" with no way to prove it | "Give clients confidence, keep your contracts" |
| **Authors & writers** | Self-published or trad-pub, substack/newsletter writers | Readers and publishers questioning authenticity | "Your words, verified" |
| **Musicians & composers** | Independent releases, sync licensing, commissions | Licensing deals increasingly require human-creation proof | "Certify your sound is yours" |
| **Galleries & art buyers** (secondary) | Need to verify before purchasing or exhibiting | No standard way to confirm human creation | "Verify before you buy" |

## 3. Launch Phases

### Phase 1: Seed (Months 1-2) — Build credibility with early adopters

**Goal:** 200 registered artists, 500+ certificates issued

- **Artist outreach:** Personally contact 50-100 artists across Instagram, Threads, and Bluesky who have publicly spoken about anti-AI art sentiment. Offer free Portfolio tier (10 certs) in exchange for feedback and a testimonial.
- **Community seeding:** Post in r/ArtistLounge, r/freelance, r/illustration, r/writing, and relevant Discord servers (art, writing, music production). Focus on discussion-style posts, not ads: "How do you prove to clients your work isn't AI?"
- **Content piece:** Publish a blog post / long thread: "The Trust Problem: Why 'I didn't use AI' isn't enough anymore" — cite real examples of artists losing commissions or facing accusations.
- **Product Hunt launch:** Prepare for a PH launch at end of Phase 1. Collect early testimonials and certificate examples to showcase.

### Phase 2: Grow (Months 3-5) — Build organic channels

**Goal:** 1,000 artists, consistent weekly sign-ups

- **SEO content strategy** (see Section 5)
- **Social media cadence:** 4-5 posts/week across Instagram, Threads, X, Bluesky
- **Partnership outreach:** Contact 10-15 online art marketplaces (Etsy alternatives, Saatchi Art, Artfinder, Society6) about integrating or recognising Officially Human Art badges
- **Creator showcase:** Weekly spotlight of a certified artist — interview-style post featuring their work and process. Builds content library and gives artists a reason to share.
- **Referral programme:** "Give a friend a free certificate, get a certificate credit." Simple, no code needed — just a referral link.

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 6-12) — Paid acquisition and partnerships

**Goal:** 5,000+ artists, revenue from Portfolio/Unlimited tiers

- **Paid ads:** Instagram and Meta ads targeting art, illustration, and writing interest groups. Lead with the problem ("Are clients asking if you used AI?"), not the product.
- **Gallery/marketplace partnerships:** Offer white-label verification or API access to galleries and platforms that want to offer "human-verified" badges on listings.
- **Conference/event presence:** Attend or sponsor booths at illustration/art events (e.g., ELCAF, Thought Bubble, local art fairs). Physical certificates with QR codes are a strong demo.
- **Press/media:** Pitch the story angle to creative industry press (It's Nice That, Creative Boom, The Creative Independent, Frieze) — the angle is "how artists are fighting back against AI doubt."

## 4. Channel Strategy

### Social Media

| Platform | Why | Content type |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| **Instagram** | Visual-first, where artists already are | Certificate showcases, artist spotlights, carousel explainers, Reels of the verification process |
| **Threads** | Growing art community, good for discussion | Opinion posts, conversation starters about AI and authenticity |
| **X / Twitter** | Art Twitter is vocal about AI issues | Hot takes, retweet artists using their badges, link to verification pages |
| **Bluesky** | Many artists migrated here specifically over AI concerns | Community-first content, genuine engagement |
| **TikTok** | Reach younger creators | Short demos, "POV: a buyer questions if your painting is AI" skits, certificate reveal videos |
| **LinkedIn** | Reach freelance designers, agencies, galleries | Professional angle — "how to protect your creative business" |

### Content Marketing / SEO

Target keywords (see Section 5) with blog content on the Officially Human Art site. This is a long-term play but the search volume for AI-art-related queries is growing fast.

### Email

- Collect emails via the free certificate sign-up
- Monthly newsletter: certified artist spotlights, new features, industry news about AI and creative authenticity
- Drip sequence for new sign-ups: welcome > how to get Gold tier > embed your badge > upgrade to Portfolio

## 5. SEO & Content Strategy

**Target keywords:**

| Keyword cluster | Example terms | Content type |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Proof of human creation | "prove art is not AI", "human made art certificate", "AI free art verification" | Landing pages, blog posts |
| Artist protection | "protect art from AI accusations", "how to prove I didn't use AI" | How-to guides |
| Buyer verification | "is this art AI generated", "verify human made art", "art authenticity check" | Verification landing page, blog posts |
| Industry trends | "AI art controversy", "human vs AI art debate", "anti AI art movement" | Opinion pieces, trend reports |

**Content calendar (ongoing):**
- 2 blog posts/month minimum
- 1 artist case study/month
- 1 industry commentary piece/month

## 6. Messaging Framework

### For Artists

- **Headline:** "Your work deserves proof."
- **Problem:** AI-generated content has flooded the market. Even if you never touch AI tools, buyers, clients, and galleries now question authenticity by default.
- **Solution:** Officially Human Art gives you a verifiable, evidence-backed certificate that proves your work is human-made. Not just your word — your evidence.
- **CTA:** "Certify your first work free."

### For Buyers/Galleries

- **Headline:** "Trust what you're buying."
- **Problem:** There's no reliable way to know if a piece was human-created. AI detection tools are unreliable. Artist statements are unverifiable.
- **Solution:** Officially Human Art certificates are backed by process evidence — photos, sketches, notes, timelapses. Scan the QR code, check the tier, see the proof.
- **CTA:** "Verify a certificate."

### Tone of voice
- Authoritative but not stuffy
- Pro-artist, not anti-technology
- Trustworthy — notary aesthetic, not startup hype
- Frame it as empowerment, not fear

## 7. Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Phase 1 target | Phase 2 target | Phase 3 target |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Registered artists | 200 | 1,000 | 5,000 |
| Certificates issued | 500 | 3,000 | 15,000 |
| Verification page visits | 1,000 | 10,000 | 50,000/mo |
| Conversion to paid tier | — | 5% | 8-10% |
| Badge embeds (external sites) | 50 | 500 | 2,000 |
| Email list | 300 | 2,000 | 10,000 |

## 8. Budget Considerations (Lean Start)

- **Phase 1 (Seed):** Effectively free. Time investment only. Free tier giveaways for early adopters. Domain, hosting on Railway.
- **Phase 2 (Grow):** ~£200-500/month — simple design tools (Canva Pro), email platform (free tier of ConvertKit/Buttondown), maybe a freelance writer for 1-2 SEO posts.
- **Phase 3 (Scale):** ~£1,000-3,000/month — paid social ads, event costs, potential PR support.
