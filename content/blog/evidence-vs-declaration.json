        "Let me start with an analogy that probably applies to something you buy regularly.",

        "Walk into a grocery store and look at the organic section. Those boxes and labels say \"Organic.\" You probably believe them. You might pay a premium because of that label. But why?",

        "Nobody just trusts the word \"organic\" anymore. We trust the USDA organic seal because there's a standard behind it. Farms are audited. Pesticide use is documented. Supply chains are tracked. There's accountability.",

        "The label only has value because someone actually verified the claim.",

        "For years, the art world relied on something very different: pure declaration. An artist says their work is human-made. A gallery says they don't accept AI work. A marketplace puts up a pledge. These are declarations \u2014 promises without proof.",

        "And they're increasingly not working.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "The Declaration-Only Model Has Failed" },

        "It's not because artists are dishonest. Most are deeply honest about their process. But a declaration is only as trustworthy as the system backing it up, and the art world doesn't have one.",

        "When a collector sees \"I didn't use AI\" on your portfolio, what are they actually verifying? Nothing. They're taking you at your word. Which is fine if they know you personally, or if you have a decades-long reputation they can verify against. But for emerging artists, for anyone new to an audience, a declaration is just words.",

        "The second problem: bad actors exploit declarations. Someone uses AI but claims it's human-made. Someone trains an AI system on others' work and declares it original. Someone uses AI as a base layer and claims they \"painted over it.\" Because there's no standard and no verification, these claims are indistinguishable from honest ones.",

        "This isn't the artist community's fault. It's a structural problem. We've built a system where claims and proof are separate things, and people have learned to assume the worst.",

        "Galleries increasingly ask for documentation. Collectors demand evidence. Platforms add AI policies. But nobody has a consistent standard that actually verifies anything. The trust keeps eroding.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "The Evidence Model: How Organic Certification Works for Art" },

        "Now imagine if art operated more like organic certification.",

        "Instead of just saying \"I didn't use AI,\" you could show your actual creative process. Here's my first sketch. Here's my second iteration. Here's the colour study I did. Here's the reference photos I used. Here's my work file with all the layers. Here's video of me painting. Here's the notes I wrote during the creative process.",

        "This is evidence.",

        "The difference is fundamental: <strong>AI cannot retroactively produce evidence of a genuine creative process.</strong>",

        "An AI system can generate a finished image instantly. In seconds. You can get something polished, compelling, and complete. But it cannot create a series of dated sketches showing conceptual exploration. It cannot produce a Photoshop file with ten years of layer history. It cannot generate genuine handwritten notes from your creative thinking, timestamped and coherent across days or weeks.",

        "A creator actually making work over time leaves a trail. Decisions. Revisions. Evolution. False starts that teach you something. Technical choices that make sense in context but would be bizarre in isolation. This trail is difficult to fake and almost impossible to create retroactively.",

        "When you document your process and submit it as evidence, you're not asking someone to take your word. You're showing them the actual journey your work took from conception to completion. You're making a claim that's verifiable because it's backed by real documentation.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Why Tiers Matter" },

        "Not all evidence is equal. A sketch and a phone photo don't prove quite as much as sketches, photos, process notes, and a timelapse video together. A single piece of documentation is more credible than none. Multiple pieces over time are more credible still.",

        "This is where tiered certification makes sense:",

        { "type": "list", "items": [
            "<strong>Bronze</strong> \u2014 a declaration and basic evidence (a few process photos or drafts). A useful starting point and valuable for emerging artists.",
            "<strong>Silver</strong> \u2014 more extensive documentation (multiple sketches, drafts, revision history, process notes). Substantial evidence of a genuine creative journey.",
            "<strong>Gold</strong> \u2014 comprehensive evidence package with video, detailed notes, and an extensive creative history. Thoroughly verified."
        ]},

        "The tiers aren't about gatekeeping. They're about creating meaningful signals.",

        "For a buyer, a Gold-certified work is backed by a larger body of evidence. For an emerging artist, a Bronze certification is still valuable \u2014 it shows you have documentation and you're willing to be verified. For an established artist building on years of public work history, it confirms what their audience already knows.",

        "Each tier tells a story. And the story is: \"This creator submitted evidence. They signed a declaration. Here's what they showed us.\"",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "\"Isn't This a Lot of Work?\"" },

        "Here's the thing that might surprise you: you're probably already doing most of this.",

        "If you work digitally, you're already saving files. The Photoshop document with layers is sitting on your computer. You're already taking phone photos of your progress sometimes. You're already keeping the sketches and drafts because you haven't thrown them out.",

        "If you work on paper, you've probably photographed your work at different stages. You have sketches in notebooks. You might even have some notes about your process lying around.",

        "Certification doesn't ask you to start doing something new. It asks you to be intentional about documentation you're likely already creating. To organise it. To think about saving it in formats that are useful for verification.",

        "Is it additional effort? Yes, a little. But the effort is mostly in being thoughtful \u2014 taking that photo at key stages, keeping the sketch rough, saving the revision history instead of flattening the file.",

        "And more importantly: that effort already exists in the real creative process. Genuine creation does take time. It does involve revision. It does have a documented history. Showing that history isn't artificial burden \u2014 it's just being honest about how real creative work actually happens.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "What Evidence-Based Certification Actually Guarantees" },

        "Let's be clear about what it is and isn't.",

        "An evidence-based certificate from a verified platform proves that you submitted real evidence of a genuine creative process and that you signed a declaration. It's not a copyright registration. It's not a legal document. It's not a watermark or DRM. It's not saying \"this work is good\" or \"this is valuable.\"",

        "What it says is: \"This creator documented their process. They submitted evidence. It checks out. Here's a public record you can verify.\"",

        "That's actually a lot. In a world of scepticism and AI-generated images, a verifiable record of authentic creative process is valuable. It solves the trust problem in a way that algorithms and assumptions never could.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "The Direction Forward" },

        "Trust is hard to build and easy to destroy. Right now, the art world is in a period of erosion. Scepticism is default. Creators are exhausted from proving themselves. Buyers are cynical about claims.",

        "The way out isn't detecting AI \u2014 detection doesn't work. It's building real verification systems. Standards. Evidence-based proof that shows what actually happened during creation.",

        "The future of authenticity in art isn't declarations. It's honest documentation. It's showing your work \u2014 literally. It's building a verifiable record of genuine creative process and inviting people to look at it.",

        "That's not future tech. That's not complex. That's just what real creation already is. We just need to document it intentionally, verify it rigorously, and make the record publicly visible.",

        "Because organic certification worked in food. It worked because of standards, verification, and transparency. The same model works for art.",
