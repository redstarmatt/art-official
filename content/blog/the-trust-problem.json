        "When you buy organic food, you don't just take the farmer's word for it. There's a label, a certification body, and a set of standards behind it. The label doesn't mean non-organic food is bad \u2014 it means that if this distinction matters to you, there's a reliable way to know what you're getting.",

        "Creative work doesn't have that yet. But it needs to.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "A missing label" },

        "AI-generated content has become indistinguishable from human-made work in many contexts. That's not necessarily a problem \u2014 AI tools have legitimate uses. The problem is that there's no reliable way to tell the difference when it matters.",

        "Some buyers want to support human creators. Some collectors care about provenance. Some clients need to know a real person made the work they're commissioning. Right now, all they have to go on is a verbal promise. And in a market where anyone can claim anything, that's not enough.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Why detection doesn't work" },

        "AI detection tools are unreliable \u2014 they flag genuine human work as AI-generated and miss obvious machine output. They treat every artist as a suspect. Verbal declarations aren't much better: anyone can say 'I didn't use AI', and there's no way for a buyer to verify it.",

        "What's missing isn't better detection. It's a standard \u2014 like the organic label \u2014 that creators can opt into and buyers can trust.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Evidence over detection" },

        "Human creation leaves traces: sketches, work-in-progress photos, timelapses, notes, physical materials. AI can generate a finished image in seconds, but it can't produce a plausible three-hour timelapse of painting it.",

        "That's the foundation for a certification that actually means something. Not detection \u2014 documentation.",

        "Officially Human Art is evidence-based certification. Artists submit their work alongside process evidence, and a trust tier is assigned:",

        ]},

        "Each certified work gets a verification page, an embeddable badge, and a QR code \u2014 like a quality mark you can display wherever your work is sold. More evidence means a higher tier, and buyers can decide what level of assurance they need.",
