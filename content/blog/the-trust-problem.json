        "A freelance illustrator lands their dream commission. Weeks of work. The client loves it. Then comes the email: 'Our legal team needs confirmation this wasn't AI-generated. Can you provide proof?'",

        "There's no standard for that. No answer. And increasingly, 'trust me' isn't good enough.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Why existing solutions fail" },

        "AI detection tools are unreliable \u2014 they flag genuine human work as AI-generated and miss obvious machine output. They treat every artist as a suspect. Verbal declarations aren't much better: anyone can say 'I didn't use AI', and there's no way for a buyer to verify it.",

        "The gap is clear: there's no trusted, verifiable standard for proving human creation.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Evidence over detection" },

        "The question isn't 'how do we detect AI?' \u2014 it's 'how do we demonstrate human process?' Human creation leaves traces: sketches, work-in-progress photos, timelapses, notes, physical materials. AI can generate a finished image in seconds, but it can't produce a plausible three-hour timelapse of painting it.",

        "That's the asymmetry we need. Not detection \u2014 documentation.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "How it works" },

        "Officially Human Art is evidence-based certification. Artists submit their work alongside process evidence, and a trust tier is assigned:",

            "Silver \u2014 process evidence included (WIP photos, sketches, notes)",
            "Gold \u2014 rich documentation (timelapse, dated files, extensive process evidence)"
        ]},

        "Each certified work gets a verification page, an embeddable badge, and a QR code. Anyone can check the tier and see the evidence behind it. More evidence means more trust \u2014 and buyers can decide what level they need.",

        "Human creation isn't just about the output. It's about the process \u2014 the hours, the decisions, the drafts, the mistakes. That process leaves evidence. And evidence can be verified.",
