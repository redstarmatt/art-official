        "A freelance illustrator lands their dream commission. Weeks of work. The client loves it. Then comes the email: 'Our legal team needs confirmation this wasn't AI-generated. Can you provide proof?'",

        "What proof? A signed statement? A timelapse? A sworn oath?",

        "There's no standard. No answer. And increasingly, 'trust me' isn't good enough.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "The landscape has changed" },

        "In 2022, AI art was a novelty. By 2023, it had flooded stock sites, social media, and marketplaces. Now, in 2025 and beyond, buyers, clients, and platforms can't tell the difference \u2014 and they know it.",

        "The consequence is that everyone is now under suspicion. Traditional artists have been publicly accused of using AI. Platforms like DeviantArt and ArtStation have faced backlash over AI-generated content. Etsy sellers report drops in sales as buyers grow wary of what's real and what isn't.",

        "The irony is sharp: the people most harmed are the human artists who never touched AI tools.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Why existing solutions fail" },

        "AI detection tools are built on flawed assumptions. They look for statistical patterns, but those patterns produce false positives that flag genuine human work as AI-generated, and false negatives that let machine output pass undetected. They're adversarial by nature \u2014 treating every artist as a suspect. Even the major tools have publicly acknowledged their limitations.",

        { "type": "quote", "text": "Using AI detection on art is like using a lie detector in court \u2014 it feels scientific, but it's not reliable." },

        "'I didn't use AI' statements are equally problematic. Anyone can say it. There's no standard format, no accountability, and no way for a buyer to verify the claim. Platforms have added 'human-made' tags, but they're just checkboxes \u2014 a tick that means nothing without evidence behind it.",

        "Blockchain and NFT solutions missed the mark too. They proved ownership, not creation method. Minting an AI-generated image on a blockchain doesn't make it human-made. The technology solved the wrong problem.",

        "The gap is clear: there's no trusted, verifiable standard for proving human creation.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "What would actually work?" },

        "The question isn't 'how do we detect AI?' \u2014 it's 'how do we demonstrate human process?'",

        "Human creation leaves traces:",

        { "type": "list", "items": [
            "Sketches and drafts that show the evolution of an idea",
            "Work-in-progress photos with context across different stages",
            "Timelapse recordings of the actual work being created",
            "Notes, reference gathering, and iteration",
            "Physical evidence \u2014 paint tubes, canvases, instrument recordings"
        ]},

        "This evidence is hard to fake. AI can generate a finished image in seconds, but it can't generate a plausible three-hour timelapse of painting it. It can't produce a sketchbook page with coffee stains and crossed-out ideas. Process evidence is the asymmetry we need.",

        "Think of it like a notary. A notary doesn't verify the content of a document \u2014 they verify the identity and intent of the signer. A certification system doesn't need to 'detect' AI. It needs to verify that a human process occurred.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Introducing a trust layer" },

        "This is what we built with Officially Human Art. Not another detection tool, but evidence-based certification.",

        "Artists submit their work alongside process evidence. That evidence is reviewed and a trust tier is assigned:",

        { "type": "list", "items": [
            "Bronze \u2014 your finished work plus a signed declaration",
            "Silver \u2014 process evidence included (work-in-progress photos, sketches, notes)",
            "Gold \u2014 rich documentation (timelapse, dated files, extensive process evidence)"
        ]},

        "Each certified work gets a permanent verification page, an embeddable badge, and a QR code. Anyone \u2014 a buyer, a gallery, a client \u2014 can check the certification tier and see the evidence behind it.",

        "The tiers matter because not everyone has timelapse software running. But someone who submits a thirty-minute timelapse has more credibility than someone who ticks a box. Buyers can decide what level of trust they need. Artists are rewarded for transparency, not penalised for not having perfect documentation.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "This isn't anti-technology" },

        "AI tools have legitimate uses across many industries, including creative ones. Officially Human Art is not an anti-AI platform. It's about transparency and choice.",

        "Some creators choose not to use generative AI. Some buyers want to specifically support human-made work. Both of those positions are valid, and both deserve a reliable way to connect with each other. AI-generated art and human-made art can coexist \u2014 but only if we can tell them apart.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "What you can do today" },

        "If you're a creator who wants to prove your work is human-made, you can start for free. Your first three certificates cost nothing, and the process is straightforward:",

            "Share it wherever your work is sold or displayed"
        ]},

        "The trust problem isn't going away. As AI gets better, the question 'is this human?' will get harder to answer by looking at the output alone.",

        "But human creation isn't just about the output. It's about the process \u2014 the hours, the decisions, the drafts, the mistakes. That process leaves evidence. And evidence can be verified.",
