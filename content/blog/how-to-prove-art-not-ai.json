        "If you've been selling or sharing art online in the past year, you've probably felt it: the shift in how people engage with creative work. A collector clicks on your piece. They love it. But instead of buying, they ask: \"Wait \u2014 did you actually make this?\"",

        "It's an exhausting question when the answer is obviously yes. You painted it. You drew it. You spent weeks on it, and you remember every decision you made. But \"I made it\" doesn't seem to be enough anymore. The skepticism is real, and it's not entirely unfounded. AI-generated images are everywhere, and most people have no reliable way to tell the difference.",

        "So what can you actually do about it?",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "The AI Detection Problem Nobody Talks About" },

        "Before we talk about how to prove you didn't use AI, let's be honest about something: <strong>AI detection tools don't work reliably.</strong> This isn't a controversial statement \u2014 it's what the research shows.",

        "Studies have found that AI detectors have staggering false positive rates. They flag human artwork as AI-generated. They miss actual AI images. Some detectors are barely better than random guessing. Even worse, they're inconsistent \u2014 the same image might get flagged by one tool and pass another.",

        "Why? Because AI and human art don't have some fundamental, detectable difference the way a DNA test can prove paternity. A detector is making statistical guesses based on pixel patterns, colour distributions, and other learned features. These patterns overlap constantly.",

        "The other problem: <strong>AI systems are improving at an incredible pace.</strong> A detector trained on today's AI output will be obsolete in three months. Relying on detection tools is like trying to predict the stock market \u2014 the moment you think you've found the pattern, everything changes.",

        "This matters because it means detection tools aren't the answer. They never will be. Anyone selling you an AI detector as a trust solution is selling you false confidence.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Why \"I Didn't Use AI\" Doesn't Work" },

        "Here's the fundamental problem: a declaration has no value without enforcement.",

        "Anyone can say they didn't use AI. A collector or gallery has no way to verify it. You could be the most ethical artist alive, and a buyer would have zero reason to believe you over the next artist who makes the same claim but uses Midjourney as a starting point.",

        "This isn't cynicism \u2014 it's economics. Trust requires credibility, and credibility requires proof.",

        "When you buy something labelled organic, you believe it because there's a certification system behind it. Standards exist. There's documentation. There's accountability. \"Trust me, it's organic\" would never be enough.",

        "The same logic applies to art. A verbal assurance or even a signed statement doesn't solve the trust problem because there's no standard, no evidence, and no consequence for lying.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "How to Actually Prove Your Work Is Human-Made" },

        "So what does work? Building a record of your process.",

        "This is not theoretical. If you created a piece of art, you created it <em>over time</em>. You made decisions. You revised. You abandoned ideas and tried new ones. You experimented. You probably made mistakes and fixed them. This creative journey \u2014 this <strong>process</strong> \u2014 is the thing that AI cannot retroactively fake.",

        "An AI system can generate a finished image in seconds. But it cannot produce a genuine creative history. It cannot create a time-stamped sequence of sketches, drafts, revisions, and decision-making notes that actually shows the progression from concept to completion.",

        "This is why documenting your process is the most credible form of proof.",

        { "type": "h3", "text": "Practical Methods for Right Now" },

        "<strong>Photograph your work in progress.</strong> Keep your phone nearby while you create. Take photos of your canvas, sketchbook, or screen at different stages. You don't need professional photography \u2014 just genuine documentation. These photos become evidence of your creative journey.",

        "<strong>Save revision history.</strong> If you work digitally, export versions of your file at key stages. Name them clearly. Keep the file with multiple layers intact so someone can see the structure. If you work on paper, photograph stages before you move to the next.",

        "<strong>Save your sketches and drafts.</strong> The rough versions are often more valuable as proof than the final piece. They show exploration, false starts, evolution.",

        "<strong>Keep notes about your thinking.</strong> Write down what you were trying to solve. What inspired the work. What techniques you experimented with. What changed and why. This doesn't need to be polished \u2014 raw process notes are more credible anyway.",

        "<strong>Create timelapses.</strong> Video or screen recording during creation is powerful proof. You don't need to be interesting or fast \u2014 just document the real time passing while you work.",

        "<strong>Archive publicly over time.</strong> If you post work-in-progress images on Instagram or your website as you create, you build a public record. This is powerful because it's documented in real-time, difficult to fake retroactively.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "The Certification Solution" },

        "Personal documentation is a start. But there's a more formal approach: <strong>evidence-based certification.</strong>",

        "Some platforms now allow you to submit this evidence \u2014 photos, sketches, drafts, process notes, even video \u2014 along with a signed declaration. The platform records it all and issues a public certificate. Higher tiers of certification exist depending on how much evidence you provide.",

        "The key difference from detection tools: it's not trying to analyse the image itself. It's asking you to prove your actual process. To show the journey. To build a record that's credible because it's detailed and documented.",

        "This solves the trust problem in a way that declarations or detection tools never could. A buyer or gallery can look at your certificate. They can see you submitted evidence. They can verify the certificate publicly. It's transparent, verifiable, and based on actual documentation \u2014 not algorithms trying to guess.",

        "The even better part: you probably already have most of this evidence. The phone photos of your work-in-progress. The Photoshop file with all layers. The sketches in your notebook. Certification isn't asking you to do something new \u2014 it's formalising what you're already doing.",

        { "type": "heading", "text": "Moving Forward" },

        "The trust problem is real, and it won't disappear. But the solution isn't detection tools or just asking people to believe you. It's evidence. Process. Documentation. The actual creative record of how you made what you made.",

        "Start documenting today if you haven't already. Take that photo of your work at the next stage. Save those files. Keep those notes. Build a record of your authentic creative process.",

        "Because in the end, that record is worth infinitely more than any algorithm claiming to spot AI. It's real proof from a real creator \u2014 and that's something nobody can fake.",
