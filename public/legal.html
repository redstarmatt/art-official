            <!-- TERMS OF SERVICE -->
            <h2 id="terms">Terms of Service</h2>

            <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
            <p>By accessing or using Officially Human Art ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

            <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
            <p>Officially Human Art provides a self-declaration registry where creators can record that their creative works were made without generative AI. The Service issues certificates based on creators' own declarations. Officially Human Art does not independently verify, audit, or guarantee the accuracy of any declaration made by a creator.</p>

            <h3>3. Creator Declarations</h3>
            <p>When submitting work for certification, creators make a voluntary declaration that their work is authentically human-made. This declaration is the sole responsibility of the creator. Officially Human Art acts only as a registry for these declarations and makes no independent assessment of whether a work was in fact created without AI assistance.</p>

            <h3>4. No Guarantee or Warranty</h3>
            <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. Officially Human Art does not warrant that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any certified work is genuinely free of AI-generated content</li>
                <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free</li>
                <li>Certificates will be accepted or recognised by any third party</li>
                <li>The evidence provided by creators is authentic or complete</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Officially Human Art, its operators, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your use of or inability to use the Service</li>
                <li>Any reliance placed on a certificate issued through the Service</li>
                <li>Any dispute between a creator and a buyer, collector, publisher, or any other third party regarding the authenticity or provenance of a work</li>
                <li>Any false or misleading declaration made by a creator</li>
                <li>Unauthorised access to or alteration of your data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Third-Party Disputes</h3>
            <p>Officially Human Art is not a party to any transaction, agreement, or relationship between creators and any third party (including buyers, collectors, galleries, publishers, or platforms). Any dispute arising from the sale, licensing, or use of a certified work is solely between the parties involved. Officially Human Art bears no responsibility for resolving such disputes and accepts no liability for any loss or damage arising from them.</p>

            <h3>7. Certificate Revocation</h3>
            <p>Officially Human Art reserves the right to revoke any certificate if there is reasonable evidence that the accompanying declaration was false or misleading. Revocation does not create any obligation on Officially Human Art's part to notify third parties or compensate any party for losses.</p>

            <h3>8. Account Responsibility</h3>
            <p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must not impersonate another person or submit work created by someone else.</p>

            <h3>9. Modifications</h3>

            <h3>Reliance at Your Own Risk</h3>
            <p>Any person or entity relying on an Officially Human Art certificate does so entirely at their own risk. We strongly recommend that buyers, collectors, and other third parties conduct their own due diligence before making decisions based on a certificate.</p>
