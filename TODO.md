## Pending
- [ ] Review "Date of Creation" label — consider "Date Created" or "Date Completed"
- [ ] Configure Stripe for production (set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, STRIPE_CREATOR_PRICE_ID on Railway)
  - Create Product + £5/month Price in Stripe dashboard, set up webhook endpoint
- [ ] Set up custom domain email via GoDaddy
  - Buy domain on GoDaddy, add GoDaddy Workspace Email (or Microsoft 365)
  - Create mailbox e.g. noreply@officiallyhuman.art
  - Set Railway env vars: SMTP_HOST=smtpout.secureserver.net, SMTP_PORT=465, SMTP_USER=noreply@officiallyhuman.art, SMTP_PASS=<mailbox password>, SMTP_FROM=noreply@officiallyhuman.art
  - GoDaddy handles SPF/DKIM automatically for its own email
- [x] Data protection risk assessment
- [x] General risk assessment
- [x] Security headers (helmet — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- [x] HTTPS enforcement (redirect + HSTS in production)
- [x] Server-side file type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP only)
- [x] Randomised upload filenames (UUIDs instead of timestamp + original name)
- [x] Private evidence file access control (ownership-checked serving)
- [x] Self-hosted Google Fonts (eliminated external Google dependency)
- [x] Sanitised Stripe error messages (no internal details exposed to client)
- [x] Strengthened password policy (8+ chars, common password blocklist)
- [x] Legacy passwordless login removed (must use password reset)
- [x] Audit logging (structured JSON logs for auth, certificates, reports, account deletion)
- [x] Profile editing endpoint (PUT /api/artist/:artistId)
- [x] Input length limits on all text fields

### Still pending (from risk assessments)
- [ ] Server-side session management (signed cookies or JWT — replaces artistId-as-auth)
- [ ] CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- [ ] Persistent rate limiting (Redis — survives server restarts)
- [ ] Migrate from JSON file to SQLite or PostgreSQL
- [ ] Automated backup strategy for database and uploads
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting (uptime, errors, disk space)
- [ ] Email verification on registration
- [ ] Admin/moderation panel for dispute resolution and content takedown
- [ ] Data export endpoint for DSAR compliance (Art. 15/20 UK GDPR)
- [ ] Data processing agreements with Stripe, SMTP provider, Railway
- [ ] Data retention policy (automated cleanup of inactive accounts)
- [ ] Copyright/takedown policy and process
- [ ] Automated test suite for critical paths
